# Current Project State

Last updated: 2026-06-30

## Summary

The production forecast writer is the VM only. VibeCode/Blackhole is a
read-only embedded UI/API over ClickHouse and must not run forecast generation.

## Production Source Of Truth

- Production VM: `root@201.51.7.24`
- VM path: `/opt/demand-forecasting-model`
- VM hostname observed: `msk-1-vm-tpez`
- VM systemd timer: `forecast-production.timer`
- VM timer schedule: daily `03:30:00 UTC`
- VM repo state observed: behind origin by docs/handoff only; production code
  was effectively current during the 2026-06-28 audit.

## Embedded App

- VibeCode server id: `82bb03a8-c356-4225-97a4-a1540cdc29e6`
- VibeCode server name: `bakery-forecast-embedded`
- VibeCode app URL: `https://app-8613ac40f10d.vibecode.bitrix24.tech`
- Mode: `BLACKHOLE`
- Role: read-only FastAPI/UI for Bitrix24 users.
- Forecast generation on VibeCode/Blackhole is forbidden.

## Active Forecast

- Active run on 2026-06-29: `prod_uplifted_bakery_norm_uplift_sku_20260629_h14`
- Horizon: `2026-06-29` through `2026-07-12`
- Scenario: `uplifted_norm`
- Horizon days: `14`
- Recent correction mode: `runner_city_prior_soft_weekpart`
- Recent correction days: `30`
- Recent sales table: `mart_sales_60d`
- Dataset refresh: enabled on the VM (`FORECAST_REFRESH_DATASETS=1`)
- Weather refresh: enabled on the VM (`FORECAST_REFRESH_WEATHER=1`)

Observed active snapshot rows after the 2026-06-29 refresh:

- `bakery_forecast_day_snapshots`: `2842`
- `sku_forecast_day_snapshots`: `460708`
- `sku_forecast_hour_snapshots`: `5014812`

Observed active weather context after the 2026-06-29 refresh:

- `forecast_day_context_embedded`: `126` rows
- Date range: `2026-06-29` through `2026-07-12`
- Default-weather rows (`temp_mean=10`, `precipitation=0`,
  `is_bad_weather=0`): `0`

## Current Timers

Must be enabled and active:

- VM `forecast-production.timer`

Must remain disabled and inactive:

- Blackhole `forecast-production.timer`
- Blackhole `forecast-production.service`
- Blackhole `bakery-forecast-nightly.timer`
- Blackhole `bakery-forecast-nightly.service`

## Important Incident Fixed On 2026-06-28

The active ClickHouse run was being overwritten after the VM job by an old
Blackhole timer. The stale writer ran from VibeCode/Blackhole host
`fhmab3h2o3lo0jqd552k`, path `/opt/forecast_job`, and loaded:

- stale run: `prod_uplifted_bakery_norm_uplift_sku_20260601_h14`
- source IP in ClickHouse query log: `84.201.174.223`

Action taken:

- Re-activated fresh run `prod_uplifted_bakery_norm_uplift_sku_20260623_h14`.
- Disabled Blackhole `forecast-production.timer`.
- Verified VM timer remains active and ClickHouse active run is consistent.

## Active Run Repair On 2026-06-29

The embedded app returned `Forecast run not found` because production
`forecast_runs_embedded` had no `status = 'active'` row. The expected run was
present and active in the `_dev` serving tables, while the production table only
contained archived/draft runs.

Action taken:

- Verified VM `forecast-production.timer` was still enabled and active.
- Copied run `prod_uplifted_bakery_norm_uplift_sku_20260623_h14` from `_dev`
  serving/snapshot tables into production serving/snapshot tables.
- Activated that run through `pipelines.forecast_publish.activate_run`.
- Verified `scripts.verify_prod_deploy --env-file .env` ends with
  `VERIFY OK: env, summary, and active run are consistent`.

## Fresh Data And Weather Refresh On 2026-06-29

ClickHouse data availability was verified:

- `mart_sales_60d`: `2026-06-01` through `2026-06-29`
- `Svezhar.fct_check_lines`: `2025-12-01` through `2026-06-29`

The production VM was manually refreshed from ClickHouse data through
`2026-06-28`, producing and activating
`prod_uplifted_bakery_norm_uplift_sku_20260629_h14`.

Action taken:

- Ran production inference with dataset refresh from `2025-12-01`.
- Refreshed weather features through `2026-07-12`.
- Rebuilt and loaded dynamic `assortment_city_products` and `bakeable_products`
  from the new active run.
- Enabled `FORECAST_REFRESH_DATASETS=1` and `FORECAST_REFRESH_WEATHER=1` on the
  VM so the timer refreshes data/weather automatically.
- Patched the production refresh default history start to `2025-12-01` and made
  the bakery-day exporter tolerate empty ClickHouse windows.

## Lead-1 Backfill On 2026-06-29

The active forecast run starts on `2026-06-29`, but facts exist in ClickHouse
through `2026-06-29`. The gap for historical fact-vs-forecast comparison was
missing lead-1 snapshots for `2026-06-24` through `2026-06-28`.

Action taken:

- Added `scripts/build_prod_lead1_model_backfill.py` for gaps where no
  bakery-level lead-1 snapshot exists yet.
- The script builds each date independently using only history before that
  date, the uplifted bakery model, real weather features, ClickHouse SKU
  profiles, current assortment filter, and
  `runner_city_prior_soft_weekpart` recent correction.
- Backfill runs are loaded as draft runs named
  `backfill_uplifted_bakery_norm_uplift_sku_YYYYMMDD_h1`.
- These runs must not be activated as the main production run.

Observed ClickHouse lead-1 snapshot status at 2026-06-29 after completion:

- `2026-06-24`: loaded in bakery/SKU-day/SKU-hour snapshots
- `2026-06-25`: loaded in bakery/SKU-day/SKU-hour snapshots
- `2026-06-26`: loaded in bakery/SKU-day/SKU-hour snapshots
- `2026-06-27`: loaded in bakery/SKU-day/SKU-hour snapshots
- `2026-06-28`: loaded in bakery/SKU-day/SKU-hour snapshots

Observed loaded rows:

| date | bakery snapshots | SKU-day snapshots | SKU-hour snapshots |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `2026-06-24` | `202` | `32509` | `353367` |
| `2026-06-25` | `203` | `32557` | `354420` |
| `2026-06-26` | `203` | `32695` | `358125` |
| `2026-06-27` | `203` | `32750` | `355058` |
| `2026-06-28` | `203` | `33324` | `355353` |

## Verification Commands

On the VM:

```bash
cd /opt/demand-forecasting-model
systemctl is-enabled forecast-production.timer
systemctl is-active forecast-production.timer
systemctl list-timers --all --no-pager | grep forecast-production
.venv/bin/python -m scripts.verify_prod_deploy --env-file .env
```

Expected final line:

```text
VERIFY OK: env, summary, and active run are consistent
```

## Base-Raw Variant Evaluation (2026-06-30)

A lead-1 dev backfill (`dev_base_raw_YYYYMMDD_h1`) was run for pilot bakeries
`[20, 21, 22, 28, 80, 89, 107, 221, 222, 257]` using scenario `base_raw_uplift`
(base bakery model + raw uplift multiplier).

Initial 7-day results (2026-06-22..2026-06-28, 10 pilot bakeries):

| metric | prod (uplifted_norm) | base_raw_uplift |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| bias% | +11.9% | +6.6% |
| wMAPE% | 72.2% | 35.2% |

An extended backfill (2026-06-01..2026-06-21) is running locally (PID 30544,
log `%TEMP%\backfill_base_raw_extended.log`). After it finishes, run:

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe analyze_variants_comparison.py --start 2026-06-01 --end 2026-06-28 --variants base_raw
```

If the 28-day results confirm base_raw_uplift superiority, deploy to prod with:

```bash
# On the VM: /opt/demand-forecasting-model
.venv/bin/python -m pipelines.forecast_publish.run_production_inference \
  --env-file .env \
  --scenario base_raw_uplift \
  --activate-run base_raw_uplift \
  --refresh-datasets \
  --history-start-date 2025-12-01 \
  --notes 'switch to base_raw_uplift after pilot validation 2026-06-30'
```

This replaces the active run for ALL bakeries. There is currently no
per-bakery override mechanism in the embedded app.

## Do Not Do

- Do not run production forecast generation from VibeCode/Blackhole.
- Do not enable Blackhole forecast timers.
- Do not treat `handoffs/` as current truth without checking this file first.
- Do not manually change active ClickHouse runs except through the documented
  activation script and only after verifying the intended run id.
- Do not print secrets from `.env`, ClickHouse config, VibeCode API keys, or
  VM SSH keys.

## When This File Must Be Updated

Update this file after any change to:

- production writer ownership;
- VM host, path, timer, or schedule;
- VibeCode/Blackhole role;
- ClickHouse active run contract;
- forecast scenario, horizon, correction mode, or source tables;
- emergency production state changes.
